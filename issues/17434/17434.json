    "Description": "As a response to a post on how to find a way to report on the results of all Coded UI Tests that have been run similar to the analysis report found in MTM it was suggested that trx2html might be a solution.  When I review the home page it indicates that version .0.7.3 supports VS2012, but I don't see that version as the current download (current is 0.6).\nI downloaded the source and opened with VS2013 and found several missing files.  When I open the solution in find the Img2B64 project and files are missing.  When I perform a build, the file2wssTest.cs and V2\\TestClassRunTest.cs are missing from the trx2html.test project.\n\nAs of right now, this solution is useless to me.",
