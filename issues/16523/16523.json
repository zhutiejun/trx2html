    "Description": "If a trx file has a test that has an unhandled exception then trx2html will crash when parsing the file. There are a couple of examples of this in other bugs, and they will usually say \"The agent process was stopped while the test was running.\"\n\nI have attached a patch that seems to correct the crash and treat them as failing tests.",
